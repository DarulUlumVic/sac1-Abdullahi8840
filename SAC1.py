BEGIN
    amountAccumulated <-- principal * (1 + (annualInterestRate / compoundingFrequency))^(compoundingFrequency * time)
    RETURN amountAccumulated
END FUNCTION


1 Implement a function based on the provided compound interest formula.
2 Write code to utilize this function, passing in values from the test data, and display the calculated compound interest.
3 Construct a test table using a word processing tool, filling it with the provided test data and expected results.
